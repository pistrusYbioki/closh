## What Others Say About Radioactive Trading
  
Radioactive Trading has received many positive reviews from traders who have used the system and benefited from it. Here are some of the testimonials from their website[^3^] and other sources:

> "I have been using your system for about 6 months now and it has been the most profitable 6 months I have ever had. I have made over $40,000 in profits and have not had a losing trade yet. Your system is simple, logical and easy to follow. Thank you for sharing your knowledge and experience with us."

> <cite>- John S., California</cite>

> "I have been trading options for over 10 years and have tried many different strategies and systems. None of them compare to Radioactive Trading. This is the only system that gives me consistent profits and peace of mind. I love the fact that I can limit my risk to a small amount and still have unlimited upside potential. The income methods are brilliant and allow me to adjust my trades according to the market conditions. I highly recommend Radioactive Trading to anyone who wants to trade options successfully."
> 
> <cite>- Lisa M., New York</cite>

> "Radioactive Trading is a game changer for me. I used to trade covered calls and lost a lot of money when the market crashed in 2008. I wish I had known about Radioactive Trading back then. Now I use the RPMs and the income methods to protect my portfolio and generate income every month. I don't have to worry about market crashes anymore. Radioactive Trading is the best thing that ever happened to my trading career."
> 
> <cite>- Robert K., Texas</cite>

Of course, not everyone is satisfied with Radioactive Trading. Some critics have argued that the system is too complicated, too expensive, or too similar to other option strategies. For example, one reviewer on Elite Trader said:

> "I bought it in 2017, its a waste of money to be honest... reason for that comment is that you can replicate the same thing with less capital, with just a long call option... which the strategy acknowledges.., but states that their way, your less likely to blow out your account due to capital intensiveness.. (so basically the strategy doesn't trust you to not go crazy)"[^2^]
> 
> <cite>- MaccabiTrader</cite>

However, these criticisms may be based on misunderstanding or misapplication of the system. Radioactive Trading does not claim to be a unique or proprietary option strategy, but rather a comprehensive and methodical approach to using well-known option strategies in a way that maximizes profits and minimizes risks. The system also provides extensive education, tools, support, and guidance for traders who want to learn and apply it correctly.
  
Ultimately, the best way to judge Radioactive Trading is to try it for yourself and see if it works for you. You can download the Radioactive Trading Blueprint PDF for free from their website[^3^] and start learning how to trade with confidence, consistency, and control.
